# Find your hat is a simple 2D game
 I worked on this game as part of a [Codecademy challenge project](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/fecp-22-javascript-syntax-part-iii/modules/wdcp-22-find-your-hat/projects/find-your-hat). 
 
 This an interactive game written in `JavaScript` and running in `Node.js` using the terminal. 

## About the Game
The scenario is that the player (*) has lost their hat (^) in a field (â–‘) full of holes (O), and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.

### This is what the game looks like

## How to start the game?

From visual studio code, you'll need to open the internal terminal. 

In your terminal, make sure you are on the game directory. You may change the working directory with the `cwd` command. 

Type in your terminal `node main.js` to display the game interface in the terminal.

## Game instructions
 
- You are * and your hat is ^.
- Avoid the holes (O) and find your hat!
- Don't go out of bounds or you may lose!
- Use the u, d, l, and r keys to navigate the field.
- u = up, d = down, l = left, r = right.
- Good luck!
