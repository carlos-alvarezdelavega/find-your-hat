# Find your hat is a simple 2D game
 I worked on this game as part of a [Codecademy challenge project](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/fecp-22-javascript-syntax-part-iii/modules/wdcp-22-find-your-hat/projects/find-your-hat). This project uses `JavaScript` and `Node.js`.
