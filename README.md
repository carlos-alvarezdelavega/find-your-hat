# Find your hat is a simple 2D game
 I worked on this game as part of a [Codecademy challenge project](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/fecp-22-javascript-syntax-part-iii/modules/wdcp-22-find-your-hat/projects/find-your-hat). 
 
 This an interactive terminal game written in `JavaScript` and running in `Node.js`. 

## About the Game
The scenario is that the player has lost their hat (^) in a field (â–‘) full of holes (O), and they must navigate back to it without falling down one of the holes or stepping outside of the field.

### This is what the game looks like
